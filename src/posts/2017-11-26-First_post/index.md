It's been sometime since I looked at my own website. As a web developer I should have a site, and really it should have lots of lovely bells and whistles to show off what I can do. But this site is not going to do that.

Keep things simple. Keep it clean. Keep it elegant.

I dropped the old and much underused Wordpress install of 2014 and am now opting for the much more elegant static site generation via Gatsby.js. I am also dropping the hot pink I used to use in favor of neutral colours and have adopted an illustration of a dinosaur skeleton. The dinosaur is purely because I like the illustration.

My current platform is: -

- GitHub Pages Hosting
- Gatsby.js

That will do for now. The next few updates will include adapting the template to present more information about my company.t. Future blog posts will document development and design work that I do and experiences I have working in the web development field.
