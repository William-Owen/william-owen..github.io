There is that old expression <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">"Eat Your Own Dog Food"</a>, and I would be suspicious of a web developer who tried to sell me their services who didn\'t have one.</p>\n<p>As a web designer and developer, I should use the latest tech and have lots of lovely modern design with great features to show off what I can do. But what I can do is continuously evolving as new ideas, techniques and platforms become available. Design trends are both fleeting and subjective. I love web design and development there is no one design trend or platform that I think I could settle on being the one that fundamentally defines my company or me.</p>\n<p>The site would need to represent the pinnacle of my creative and design ability while building on the shifting sands of the modern web development technique - the site was simply impossible.</p>\n<p>But that\'s no good. So instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">Release early, release often</a></p>\n<p>So here is a new site; it\'s super simple, and crazy fast. It\'s a <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">static site</a> built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.JS</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>\n<p>I stopped worrying about it showing what I could do and was happy with it just to be live. Keep things simple. Keep it clean. Keep it elegant.</p>',id:"/Users/neotoxic/projects/William-Owen.github.io/src/posts/eating-my-own-dog-food/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2017-07-12T17:12:33.962Z",path:"/eating-my-own-dog-food",tags:["website"],title:"Eating my own dog food"}}],code:[{excerpt:"I love  Git ;  GitGub  is my go-to  version and source control  platform of choice for all my projects.
